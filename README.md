## Experimental

I've set up this repository for all the mini projects that I do, that don't really need a full repo, but that I may refer to in blog post, or just want to keep around.

As it stands I've not organised by language etc, but if I end up putting a lot of things here, then maybe I'll go down that route.

A place for all the guff!
