# Isometric Renderer

This project is a "from scratch" isometric renderer. It enables the user to generate 2D images of a 3D voxel world.

## Issues/Backlog
- Positioning of render within frame.
- Filtering blocktypes.
- 

- Renders
    - Tetris bts, piled up. higher distribution towards back to create the "slant". Place bits in first free place up from bottom, rather than "dropping" to compress them.
    - Terrain where blocks change hue/shade organically via perlin noise. Looks like mineral deposits.
    - Terrain: Perlin noise xy to give z and seperate noise to give a hue
